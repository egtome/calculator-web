## Instructions

I built the web client with pure PHP, Bootstrap and JavaScript. You need PHP 8 to run it.

- Create a database in you local environment named calculator_api
- Paste env.php file attached in email in project root directory
- Update API_URL in .env with the url where you have calculator-api
- Create a local virtual host


Thatâ€™s it, now, you can interact with the Web client.
The seeders (from API) created 3 users for you:

1. user1@test.com
2. user2@test.com
3. user3@test.com (this user has EMPTY balance, for testing purposes)

User passwords provided in the email I sent
